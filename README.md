# Exploring Used Cars from CraigList Using Regression Analysis
1. The purpose of this study is to explore and understand the factors that significantly affect the "price" of an used car
2. There are many variables that we will take into consideration, but ideally we will narrow it down to a couple variables with high influence on the dependent variable "price"
3. This study is purely explanatory

# Organization of the Analysis
- Data Cleaning: Dealing with null values, dropping unecessary columns, feature engineering
- Data Preprocessing: Putting data in the right format and scale
- Model Creation: Creating multiple models
- Model Evaluation: Assesing the goodness-of-fit by evaluating residuals and checking if conditions are met
- Conclusions: Explain what useful information we've learned from the models
